Automatic deployement test with https and machine user

# About this repo:
This is a test repo with empty files and a readme file to test automatic deployment via https, with a help of a machine user, authentication tokens and automatic pull requests to the main repo

# Terminology:
This is the main repo which is forked by a machine user. The fork is updated before evry pull cycle, and an automatic pull request will be added from the fork when a new file is generated by the machine user, or a file has been chhanged by a machine user. These pull requests then can be merged by the admin.
