# synch_https_approach
Automatic deployement test with https and machine user

# About this repo:
This is a test repo with empty files and a readme file to test automatic deployment via https, with a help of a machine user, authentication tokens and automatic pull requests to the main repo

# Terminology:
This is the main repo which is forked by a machine user. The fork is updated before evry pull cycle, and an automatic pull request will be added from the fork when a new file is generated by the machine user, or a file has been chhanged by a machine user. These pull requests then can be merged by the admin.

# Steps:
1.) Create machine user (mezdahunmachine in this case)
2.) Fork the repo with the machine user
3.) Add symmetric collaborator rights to the users: collaborator right to mezdahun in the fork, and collaborator rights to mezdahunmachine in the main repo
4.) Generate access tokens for both users with the adequate rights
5.) See the corporate project for further information from step 4.)

# Testing Fork update
This commit will serve the test of fork update. I am writing this line during the automatic pull request.
